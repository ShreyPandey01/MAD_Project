# TICTACTOE GAME
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

In this repo, we are making Tic Tac Toe - a Game of Fun with the involvement of two kinds of birds instead of previously used-zero and cross thing.
